Revision history for SOAP-WinRM

0.1     Sun Oct 2 2011 Alasdair Keyes
        First release.

0.2	Wed Feb 29 2012 Alasdair Keyes
	- Set Content-Type header to application/soap+xml instead of
	  relying on SOAP::Lite's soapversion method and setting to 1.2
	- Add alarm when calling SOAP::Lite::call to catch timeouts,
	  this generall isn't required, but when ports forwarding is in
	  place on the host, it seems to be needed, alarm is set to timeout
	  value +2 seconds.
	- execute method returns using wantarray to work out whether to
	  return scalar or array
	- SOAP responses for "receive stream" and "close" force the
	  { "rsp:ReceiveResponse" }{ "rsp:CommandState" } part of the hashref
	  to an ARRAYREF and then pop the result off the end, the earlier
	  1.1 stack often replies with this as an arrayref so it needs to
	  be handled accordingly
	- Remote stack 1.1 supported

0.3	Thu Mar 01 2012 Alasdair Keyes
	- Set Default timeout to 60 seconds same as WinRM default timeout
	- Set the OperationTimeout Header in the SOAP call to match the
	  timeout specified by the user
	- Update documentation with this information
